It's been a long few days, the sun has risen and set multiple times- I've lost count. But, the update is done.
More of an upgrade, really. I found an expansion board for one of the droids and reverse-engineered it to provide the RobCo terminal with some nice upgrades.

Firstly, More RAM. I wired up the Expansion RAM board to the System RAM board.
Secondly, More features. Using the extra memory, I gave the Journal app the ability to read the old journal file onto the screen before overwriting it. Better for correcting errors.
Thirdly, more app support. You can now run apps you found in the wild, or write new ones here in the Terminal.

I added a few myself so that you can get started. It's a little clunky, but it works.

Have fun, and don't do anything I wouldn't do...
