# Fallout3Terminal

Thank you for downloading this! This was just a little side project that I made while sick at home, but a lot of people wanted a download!

REQUIREMENTS:
You MUST have these packages installed on linux:
pv
cool-retro-term
sox

To run this script, open your terminal and enter the following:

cool-retro-term --fullscreen --noclose -e bash $HOME/Fallout3Terminal/terminalscript

You can also enter that command in your startup manager, as well as make launcher with it!
I have decided not to leave my preset for CRT in, as some people might want to give a shot at making their own CRT preset.
Give it a shot! You might want to try a New Vegas amber look!

Believe it or not, I don't actually do a lot of this kind of thing, and I instead do a lot of Digital Art! I'm still learning, but you can check me out on
@fohtla_arts on instagram. Otherwise, enjoy this little program I made for funsies!
